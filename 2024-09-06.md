## probability sampling 

### simple random sampling 

randomly assign a person a number and then use a random. number generator to then pick x number 


### systematic sampling 
split the population into groups of k interval e.g populaton is 30 and k = 5 then each group have 6 

then randomly pick one in each group


### random stratified sampling 

split population into groups based on characteristics,e.g gender,age group

then randomly pick a member from each group


### cluster sampling 

cluster population into clusters based on similarity  and then randomly sample form each cluster 


### pros and cons

| Sampling Plan           | Advantages                                          | Disadvantages                                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple Random Sample     | Good Representation of the Population              | Time-consuming; accessibility of information                |
| Systematic Sample        | Simpler selection process as opposed to Simple Random Sampling | Potentially under-representing the population                |
| Stratified Random Sample | Good Representation of Sample by Stratum           | Require Sampling Frame and criteria for classification of population into stratum |
| Cluster Random Sample    | Less time-consuming and less costly                | Require larger sample size in order to achieve low margin of error |


## non probability sampling 

selection is not done using randomness/probability 





# data variables 


# numerical 
- discrete 
- continuous ()


# categorical 
- ordinal  (e.g rating)
- nominal (e.g name)


# experimental groups 

- give a placebo 
- double blind means subject and asserrs dont know what is what hence no bias
