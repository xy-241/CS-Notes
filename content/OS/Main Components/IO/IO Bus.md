## Abstract
---
- A *communication pathway* within a computer system that facilitates the exchange of *data* between the [[CPU]], [[Main Memory]], and [[IO Device]]

## IO Bus Architecture
---
### Shared Bus Architecture
- Multiple [[IO Device]] uses the same wire to transfer data
### Parallel Bus Architecture
* Send each [[Computer Data Representation#Word]] of data over multiple wires
### Serial Bus Architecture
- Send all [[Computer Data Representation#Bit]] in a single connection/lane
