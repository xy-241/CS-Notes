## Abstract
- Resizable [[Array]], achieved by building an [[Abstraction]] above the [[Array]]

## Benefits
### Convenience 
- Developers don't need to re-write the logic of re-sizeing [[Array]] etc
- Built with best practices & battle-tested

## Cons
### More Resource Intense
- We can't fine tune every [[Array]] operations because don't have direct access
