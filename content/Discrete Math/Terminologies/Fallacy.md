## Abstract
---
- Error in *reasoning* that results in an invalid [[Mathematical Argument]]
- 3 common fallacies causes
	1. Using *Ambiguous Premises*
	2. *Circular Reasoning* (Assuming what is to be proved without having derived it from the [[Mathematical Argument#Premise]])
	3. Jumping to a [[Mathematical Argument#Conclusion]]

## Common Errors
---
### Converse Error
- Given a -> b is true & b is true, we conclude a is true
- Going against [[Rule of Inference (推理规则)#Modus Tollens]]
### Inverse Error
- Given a-> b is true & ~a is true, we conclude ~b is true
- Going against [[Conditional Statement#Vacuously True]]
