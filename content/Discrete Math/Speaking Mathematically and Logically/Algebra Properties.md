## Closure (闭包)
---
- A property of a [[Set|set]] whereby an operation on members of the set always produces a member of the same set is called **closure**. For example, integers are closed under addition and multiplication, like $1 + 1 = 2$, where $2$ is an integer (**By  closure of integers under multiplication and addition**)
## Commutativity (交换律)
---
- The **order** in which the operands are taken **does not affect** the result of the operation. Addition and multiplication are commutative, meaning $x + y = y + x$

## Associativity (结合律)
---
- You do not need to worry about the placement of parentheses in expressions with more than two operands when the operations are associative. For example, addition and multiplication are associative

## Distributivity (分配律)
---
$$
x \times (y+z) = (x\times y) + (x \times z)
$$
- Multiplication distributes over addition

## Trichotomy (三分法)
---
- For **any two given inputs** ($x$ and $y$), **exactly one** of the following three outcomes **must be true**: $x = y$, $x < y$ or $x > y$
