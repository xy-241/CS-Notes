## Abstract
---
- Also known as **Proposition** 
- **Can be presented with variables** like `p`, `q`, `r` & `s` which return either `True` or `False` etc. Statements expressed in variables are called **Statement Form**
- 3 important types are [[Conditional Statement]], [[Universal Statement]],  & [[Existential Statement]]. We can form **complex statements** that are made of more than one type

>[!tip] Keep It Atomic
>This makes the cognitive load low, easier to build on top of the statement, especially for [[Mathematical Proof]] that is complicated

>[!caution] Attention
>1. [[Predicate]] without value substituted to its [[Predicate#Predicate Variable]] isn't mathematical statement, unless it is [[Propositional Logic#Logical Equivalence]] equation that involves predicate. For example $\neg(\forall x, P(x)) \equiv \exists x, \neg P(x)$
>2. Not in a question form
>3. Either `True` or `False`, but not both at the same time



### Compound Statement
- Make up of multiple [[Mathematical Statement]], connected with [[Propositional Logic#Logical Connectives]]

>[!tip] Simplification
>When the statement has [[Conditional Statement]], convert it using [[Conditional Statement#Implication Law]] to make it much less confusing

## Special Mathematical Statements
---
### Axioms (公理)
- Universally recognized truth or principle
- [[Mathematical Statement]] assumed to be true without [[Mathematical Proof]]
### Theorem (定理)
- [[Mathematical Statement]] that is proved using **Mathematical Reasoning**
- Usually a major or important result 
### Lemma (引理)
- A small [[#Theorem (定理)]] used to help in proving a [[#Theorem (定理)]]
### Corollary (推论)
- A result that is a **simple deduction** from a [[#Theorem (定理)]]
- For example, we proof that `the product of any two odd numbers is always odd`. The corollary is `the product of two sonsecutive odd numbers is always odd`
### Conjecture (猜测)
- [[Mathematical Statement]] **believed to be true**, but there isn't a [[Mathematical Proof]] yet

## Terminologies
---
### Tautology
- [[Mathematical Statement]] that is **always true** 
### Contradiction `c`
- [[Mathematical Statement]] that is **always false**
