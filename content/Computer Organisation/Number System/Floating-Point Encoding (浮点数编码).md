   ## Abstract

![[IEEE 754 Floating-Point Rep.png|500]]

- Based on the [IEEE 754 Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)
- 32 bits in total 
- **Sign:** $0$ indicates a positive number, $1$ indicates a negative number
- **Exponent:** Comes with a bias of $- 127$, represented by all exponent bits set to 0. To obtain a positive exponent, set the 8th (most significant) bit to `1`, resulting in a value of `128`
- **Mantissa:** This represents the **fractional part of the number** after [[#Normalised Number|normalisation]]. The binary digits following the decimal point are included in the mantissa.

>[!question] Why make it so complicated?
> A more intuitive way to represent numbers with decimal points is to use **fixed-point**, where we allocate a certain number of bits for the whole number part and a certain number of bits for the fractional part. However, floating-point encoding allows us to use the same number of bits to represent **both very large and very small numbers, with high precision** thanks to the use of **exponent**.

>[!important] How Mantissa Precision Varies with Exponent
> ![[floating_point_as_an_approximation.png]]
> 
> The **mantissa** in IEEE 754 floating-point representation **determines the precision** of a number. Let's analyze how precision changes across different ranges:
> - **Range 1 to 2 ($2^0$ to $2^1$):** All 23 bits of the mantissa contribute to the precision after the decimal point.
> - **Range 2 to 4 ($2^1$ to $2^2$):** One bit is used to represent the whole number (2) before the decimal point, leaving 22 bits for precision after the decimal.
> - **Generalisation:** For every increase in the exponent by 1 (doubling the range), the precision after the decimal point decreases by a factor of 2. This is because one more bit is allocated to representing the whole number part.


>[!tip]
> To store large whole numbers, use the `long` data type. Floating-point options like `double` may introduce precision loss.
> 
> For improved readability, convert binary representations to hexadecimal. 
> 
> Here is an [Online Converter](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html) to help visualising the floating-point encoding better.

>[!question] Why 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004?
> For numbers whose binary representation requires **infinite precision**, like the decimal number $0.1$, the binary equivalent is analogous to representing $\frac{1}{3}$ in decimal form. 
> 
> With limited precision (e.g., 32 bits), we inevitably lose some accuracy. This is why 0.1 + 0.2 in binary floating-point arithmetic does not strictly equal 0.3.

>[!important] Approximation destroys associativity
> Given 3 floating points number $A$, $B$ and $C$, $(A ~op~ B) ~op~ C \neq A ~op~ (B ~op~ C)$, which is same as $D ~op~ C \neq A ~op~ E$.
> 
> [[Properties of Integer#Associativity (结合律)|Associativity]] is not guaranteed with floating-point numbers because each operation may produce an approximated value.

## Normalised Number
---

![[implicit_1.png|500]]

- In the context of [[Floating-Point Encoding (浮点数编码)]], a normalised number is one where the **leading digit** (the digit to the left of the decimal point) is **always** $1$. This $1$ is not explicitly stored **but is implicit**, thus one more bit for the mantissa for a **higher accuracy**


>[!important]
> ![[normal_number_range.png|500]]
>
> The range of real numbers between $0$ and the [[#Smallest Positive Normalised Number]] is not covered by normalised numbers, but by [[#Subnormal Number|subnormal numbers]]. 
> 
> The leading 1 is implicit in **normalised numbers when the exponent is not zero**. When the exponent is zero, we have a subnormal number, and the implicit leading 1 is no longer assumed.

### Smallest Positive Normalised Number
![[smallest_normalized_number.png]]

- One bit for *exponent* to differentiate from [[#Subnormal Number]]

### Biggest Positive Normalised Number
![[biggest_normalised_number.png]]

- All 1s for *exponent* means [[#Infinity]]



## Subnormal Number
---
- Also known as **Denormalised Number**
- Fill up the gap between 0 and the smallest [[#Normalised Number]]
- Without, we will get a 0 if the difference between 2 numbers is smaller than the smallest normalised number

 ![[importance_of_subnormal.png|500]]
 >[!caution] 
 > In non-debug mode, subnormal number maybe turned off for performance reasons, and this may lead to unexpected errors.
 
 
### Smallest Positive Subnormal Number
- The exponent bias is fixed at -126 when denormalised, and 0 is implicit instead of 1
![[smallest_denormalized_exponent.png]] 

### Biggest Positive Subnormal Number
- [[#0]] when Mantissa bits are all 0
![[biggest_denormalized.png]]




## 3 Special Cases
---
### 0
- Both Exponent & Mantissa is 0
![[float_0.png]]

### Infinity
- Exponent is 255, but Mantissa is 0
![[float_inf.png]]

### NaN
- Exponent is 255 & Mantissa isn't 0
