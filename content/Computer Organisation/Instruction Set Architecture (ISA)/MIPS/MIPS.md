## Abstract
---
- [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)#Load-Store ISA]]
- Use 32 [[Register]]
- Uses [[Memory Address#Word Addressing]], each [[Computer Data Representation#Word]] is 4 [[Computer Data Representation#Byte]]

>[!important]
> We use temporary registers `$t0` to `$t7` for intermediate results.

### MIPS General Syntax
