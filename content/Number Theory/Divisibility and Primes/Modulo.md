## Abstract
---
- Returns the **remainder** or **signed remainder** of a **division**


### Congruence Modulo
- **Congruence** means "the same"
- **Congruence Modulo** basically means **two numbers** have the **same remainder** when divided by the **same [[Factor]]**
</br>

- Represented with $\equiv$
- $a \equiv b$ (mod $m$) is read as "$a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$ 
- $a \equiv b$ (mod $m$) means that $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $m$
</br>

- $a \equiv b$ (mod $m$) is true if and only if $m|(a-b)$
- $a$ and $b$ are in the same [[Relation#Equivalence Class]] modulo $m$, $[a]_{m} = [b]_{m}$
